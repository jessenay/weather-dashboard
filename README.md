# weather-dashboard

## This is a weather dashboard application that can be used to find the current and fututure forecast for the city  of your choice. I used HTML, CSS and Javascript that I have learned throughout the bootcamp to make this application. I also used a weather API to get the forecast information for the searched cities.

## Installation 
none

## Usage 
The user must search for their desired city and push the search button in order to view the forecast for that city. It will then save the information recieved from the API and store it locally as well as display previously searched cities on the left side under the search button.
